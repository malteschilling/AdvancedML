# Footer Plugin

This is a small plugin that ensures (after the presentation has been loaded) that all slides have the defined page height, such that a footer at their bottom can consistently be added. Without this plugin, slides with few content might be shorter than the full slide height, leading to footers that are not really at the bottom of the page.
